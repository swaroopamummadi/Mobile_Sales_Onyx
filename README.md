### Charts Used
I have used zoomcharts and Default charts
 
ZoomCharts Drill-Down Time Line Charts are interactive, touch-enabled data visualization tools used primarily for exploring time-based data. These charts allow users to "drill down" into finer time intervals (e.g., from years → months → days → hours) dynamically and intuitively
ZoomCharts Drill Down Map Pro is a powerful visualization tool for hierarchical geographic or location-based data. It allows users to visually explore data from a broad geographical level down to finer granularity—like continent → country → region → city → site—through intuitive click or tap-based interactions.
